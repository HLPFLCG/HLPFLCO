# HLPFL Website Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document outlines all the improvements made to the HLPFL website (www.hlpfl.org) to address CSS loading issues, improve readability, and enhance the overall design.

---

## 1. Fixed CSS Loading Issue ✅

### Problem
- HTML files were referencing `style.css` and `mobile.css` from the root directory
- Actual CSS files were located in the `css/` subdirectory
- This caused styles to not load properly across the site

### Solution
- Updated all HTML files to correctly reference CSS files:
  - Changed `href="style.css"` to `href="css/style.css"`
  - Changed `href="mobile.css"` to `href="css/mobile.css"`
- Files updated:
  - index.html
  - about.html
  - red-flag-guide.html
  - services.html
  - shop.html
  - under-construction.html
  - vip.html

## 2. Redesigned Color Scheme ✅

### Design Philosophy
Created a professional, sleek color palette inspired by recording studios, vinyl records, and professional music spaces.

### New Color Palette

#### Primary Colors
- **Deep Charcoal Base**: `#1a1d23` - Professional yet inviting main background
- **Charcoal Sections**: `#23272f` - Slightly lighter for section differentiation
- **Mid Charcoal**: `#2d323c` - For cards and elevated elements
- **Pure White Cards**: `#ffffff` - Clean content cards with excellent contrast

#### Text Colors (High Contrast for Readability)
- **Primary Text**: `#2d3748` - Deep slate for excellent readability on light backgrounds
- **Text on Dark**: `#f8fafc` - Off-white for dark backgrounds
- **Muted Text**: `#64748b` - Secondary information
- **Light Text**: `#94a3b8` - Tertiary information

#### Signature Accent Colors
- **Rich Copper**: `#c87941` - Primary accent (distinctive music industry feel)
- **Light Copper**: `#e09560` - Hover states
- **Deep Copper**: `#a65f2f` - Pressed states
- **Deep Teal**: `#2c5f6f` - Secondary accent for professional contrast

#### Why This Palette Works
1. **Readability**: High contrast ratios ensure text is easily readable
2. **Professional**: Deep charcoal base feels sophisticated without being too dark
3. **Distinctive**: Copper/bronze tones evoke music industry (think vintage equipment, brass instruments)
4. **Sleek but Timeless**: Not overly modern, but contemporary and clean
5. **Accessible**: Meets WCAG contrast requirements
