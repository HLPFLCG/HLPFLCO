# Mobile Navigation Fixes - Summary

## Issues Reported and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Mobile Menu Visibility Issue
**Problem:** When opening the menu on mobile, the hero section was visible behind it, making it hard to use the menu.

**Solution:**
- Fixed z-index layering:
  - Menu: z-index 1001
  - Toggle button: z-index 1002
  - Header: z-index 1000
  - Hero: z-index 1
- Added semi-transparent overlay when menu is open
- Menu now appears clearly above all content

### 2. ✅ About Page Menu Issue (iPhone 16)
**Problem:** On the About page, only the X (close button) was visible, not the menu items.

**Solution:**
- Ensured menu toggle button is always visible
- Fixed menu item visibility with proper color contrast
- Added minimum height for touch targets (48px)
- Menu items now display with white text on dark background

### 3. ✅ Hero Section Spacing
**Problem:** Too much gap between the header and "Create, Record, Profit, Repeat" text.

**Solution:**
- Reduced hero padding-top from 100px to 80px on mobile
- Reduced hero-content padding-top to 10px
- Removed extra margin-top from hero title
- Better use of screen space

### 4. ✅ Footer Social Icons Not Centered
**Problem:** Social media icons in footer were not centered on mobile.

**Solution:**
- Added `justify-content: center` to footer-social
- Centered footer-brand and footer-description text
- Consistent alignment across all screen sizes

body.menu-open::before {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Adjust opacity */
}
```

### Modify Hero Spacing
```css
.hero {
  padding-top: 80px; /* Adjust as needed */
}
```

### Change Animation Speed
```css
.nav__list {
  transition: right 0.3s ease; /* Adjust duration */

## Troubleshooting

### If menu still doesn't appear:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
3. Check that mobile-fixes.css is loading in browser dev tools

### If animations are choppy:
1. Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled
2. Close other apps to free up memory
3. Update iOS to latest version

### If touch targets are too small:
1. Increase min-height in mobile-fixes.css
2. Add more padding to menu items
3. Increase font size if needed
