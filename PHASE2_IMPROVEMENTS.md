# HLPFL Website - Phase 2 Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the Phase 2 improvements made to the HLPFL website, focusing on readability fixes, image optimization, SEO enhancements, analytics tracking, and form validation.

---

## 1. H2 Readability Fix ✅

### Problem
H2 headings (section titles) were difficult to read on white background sections because they were styled for dark backgrounds.

### Solution
Added specific CSS rules for sections with white backgrounds:

```css
/* Section Headers on Light Backgrounds */
.services-preview .section-title,
.contact .section-title {
  color: var(--c-text);  /* Deep slate #2d3748 */
}

.services-preview .section-subtitle,
.contact .section-subtitle {
  color: var(--c-text-muted);  /* Muted slate #64748b */
}
```

### Impact
- ✅ Excellent readability on white sections
- ✅ Maintains high contrast (WCAG AA compliant)
- ✅ Consistent with overall design system

---

## 2. Image Optimization ✅

### Implementation
Added `loading="lazy"` attribute to all non-critical images:

**Images Optimized:**
1. Red Flag Guide cover image
2. Founder profile image
3. Footer logo

### Benefits
- ✅ Faster initial page load
- ✅ Reduced bandwidth usage
- ✅ Better performance on mobile devices
- ✅ Improved Core Web Vitals scores

### Technical Details
```html
<!-- Before -->
<img src="images/founder/IMG_0597.jpeg" alt="HLPFL Founder">

<!-- After -->
<img src="images/founder/IMG_0597.jpeg" alt="HLPFL Founder" loading="lazy">
```
