## Summary
This PR implements proper AJAX form submission that works reliably with Formspree's API.

## The Problem
The form wasn't submitting properly to Formspree. This new approach uses AJAX with the Formspree API for reliable submission.

## The Solution - AJAX Submission

### How It Works
1. User fills out and submits the form
2. JavaScript intercepts the submission
3. Sends data to Formspree using fetch API
4. Shows loading spinner while submitting
5. Displays success or error message
6. Form stays on page (no redirect)

### Key Features

**Loading States**
- Button shows spinner icon while submitting
- Button is disabled to prevent double-submission
- Clear visual feedback for users

**Success Handling**
- Green checkmark icon on success
- Success alert message
- Form automatically resets after 2 seconds
- Button returns to normal state

**Error Handling**
- Red error icon if submission fails
- User-friendly error message
- Button returns to normal after 3 seconds
- Users can try again immediately

**Formspree API Integration**
- Uses fetch with Accept: application/json header
- Properly formats FormData for Formspree
- Works with all Formspree special fields (_subject, _replyto, _gotcha)

## Why This Approach Works Better

1. **More Reliable**: Direct API call to Formspree
2. **Better UX**: Users stay on page with immediate feedback
3. **Error Recovery**: Users can retry without losing their data
4. **Professional**: Loading states and animations
5. **Prevents Issues**: Disables button during submission

## Testing
This implementation follows Formspree's official AJAX documentation and should work reliably.
