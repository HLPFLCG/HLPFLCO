## Summary
This PR updates the red flag section to match the consistent styling used throughout index.html, creating a seamless visual flow.

## Problem
The red flag section had a custom dark gradient background that didn't match the alternating white/dark pattern used in other sections of index.html.

## Solution
Updated the section to use the design system colors and match the page's established patterns.

## Key Changes

### Background
- Changed from custom dark gradient to var(--c-bg-card) (white)
- Reduced animated gradient opacity from 0.08/0.06 to 0.03 for subtlety
- Now matches the services preview and contact sections

### Typography
- Updated heading to use var(--c-text) instead of gradient text
- Changed paragraph text to var(--c-text-muted)
- Colors now work properly on light background
- Maintains readability and hierarchy

### Layout
- Reduced max-width from 1300px to 1200px (matches other sections)
- Reduced gap from 100px to 80px for consistency
- Reduced padding from 60px to 40px (standard container padding)
- Better alignment with page grid system

### Visual Effects
- Simplified shadows to use design system variables
- Reduced glow effect opacity for cleaner look
- Maintained subtle animations for visual interest
- Reduced decorative emoji size and opacity

### Design System Integration
- Uses var(--c-bg-card) for background
- Uses var(--c-text) and var(--c-text-muted) for text
- Uses var(--shadow-lg) and var(--shadow-xl) for shadows
- Uses var(--glow-gold) for hover effects
- Follows established spacing patterns

## Visual Consistency

- Dark gradient background (stood out)
- Gradient text effect
- Heavy shadows and glows

**After:**

- Consistent spacing throughout

## Benefits
- Seamless visual flow throughout the page
- Better integration with design system
- Maintains visual interest through subtle effects
- Professional, cohesive appearance
- Easier to maintain and update
